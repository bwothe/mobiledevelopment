On the the home page in the header there is a menu button. This will open a panel that has a list of links to the games I am talking about. 
There is also a link to a form for the user to add their favorite game.

Each game page has a back button in the header that will bring them back to the home page. Also on each page is a filterable list for the
game's soundtrack.

The form page also includes a back button to go back to the home page. The form has an area to type in the name of the game, a submit
button to put it in localstorage and a clear button to clear the form.
